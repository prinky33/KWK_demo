# Welcome to our Python code-along session! Today, we'll be practicing conditional statements.

# Step 1: Let's define the driving speed.
drivingSpeed = int(input("Please enter your driving speed in mph: "))

# Step 2: Now, let's assess the driving speed and provide feedback.
if drivingSpeed <= 55:
    print("You are driving within the speed limit.")
elif drivingSpeed >= 56 and drivingSpeed <= 65:
    print("You are driving slightly above the speed limit.")
else:
    print("You are driving considerably above the speed limit.")

# Great job everyone! Feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts in the chat.
