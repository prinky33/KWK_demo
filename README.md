KWK IA Python Demo
This is a python code-a-long that solves the following practice problem:
1. Define a variable named `**drivingSpeed**` and assign it an integer value representing the driver's current speed of your choice. 
2. Write a series of conditional statements to assess the driver's speed compared to the speed limit and provide appropriate feedback:
    - If the driving speed is less than or equal to 55 mph, display the message "You are driving within the speed limit."
    - If the driving speed is between 56 and 65 mph (inclusive), display the message "You are driving slightly above the speed limit."
    - If the driving speed is between 66 and above, display the message "You are driving considerably above the speed limit."
